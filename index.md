## About Me

I am currently at the University of Cambridge doing an MPhil by research in the [Computational Modelling Group](https://como.ceb.cam.ac.uk) at the department of Chemical Engineering & Biotechnology. Building knowledge graphs and creating agents to realise a digital-twin of the UK one triple at a time. Previously at University of Manchester enabling the optimisation of large scale chemical processes using machine learning. From October I'll be doing a [PhD at Imperial](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/optimisation-and-machine-learning-for-process-engineering/about-us/) focussed on machine learning and optimisation for bioprocesses. 

I am also the Co-Director of Engineering and Informatics at [Pramanta Sciences](https://www.pramanta.com) where we help inform Biotech investment decisions using bottom up analysis.
